### [Chapter 1: Into Programming](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md)
- Code
    - Syntax is the word for computer language
    - Statements are a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task
    - There are variables, literal values, and operators
    - Programs are a collection of many statments 
    - This statement has 4 expressions: literal value, variable, arithmetic, assignment
    ```
    a = b * 2;
    ```
    - JavaScript is an interpreted language meaning it is processed each time it runs
    - Other languages are compiled beforehand
- Try It Yourself
    - Use developer tools in the console of your browser to practice JavaScript
    - Use console.log() instead of alert() to output your results
    - Try out code examples:
    ```
    a = 21;
    b = a * 2;
    console.log(b);
    ```
    - We can also get input from the user
    ```
    var age = prompt('Please tell me your age:');
    console.log(age);
    ```
- Operators
    - Operators are how we perform operations on values and variables
    - Notice the source value is usually to the left of the = sign
    - We use "var" to declare variables
    - There are many operators including:
        - Assignment 
        - Math 
        - Compound assignment
        - Increment/decrement 
        - Object property access 
        - Equality 
        - Comparison 
        - Logical
- Values & Types
- Code Comments
- Variables
- Blocks
- Conditionals
- Loops
